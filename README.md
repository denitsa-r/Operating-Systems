# Operating-Systems
A repository with materials for the Operating Systems course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Sofia University.

# Main purpose 
This repo will serve as a playground for me and my boyfriend, allowing us to compete against each other and stay motivated throughout the semester.

# Rules of the game 
Each of us will commit all the exercises we have solved, and at the end of each week, the one who has solved more exercises will be taken on a date by the other. :)
